# DDXPlus: A New Dataset For Automatic Medical Diagnosis

<img src="images/diagram.png" width="800">

*Appearing in NeurIPS 2022 dataset and benchmark track*

We are releasing under the CC-BY licence a new large-scale dataset for Automatic Symptom Detection (ASD) and Automatic Diagnosis (AD) systems in the medical domain. 

The dataset contains patients synthesized using a proprietary medical knowledge base and a commercial rule-based ASD system. Patients in the dataset are characterized by their socio-demographic data, a pathology they are suffering from, a set of symptoms and antecedents related to this pathology, and a differential diagnosis. The symptoms and antecedents can be binary, categorical and multi-choice, with the potential of leading to more efficient and natural interactions between ASD/AD systems and patients.  

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset that includes the differential diagnosis, and non-binary symptoms and antecedents.

## Availability

- Our **paper** is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09148).
- The **dataset** in **French** is hosted on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DDXPlus_Dataset/20043374).
  - This is the original version of DDXPlus that all results in our paper were obtained on.
- Starting from 9 May 2023, the **dataset** is also available in **English** for easier use. This version is hosted on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/DDXPlus_Dataset_English_/22687585).

## Dataset documentation

In what follows, we use the term *evidence* as a general term to refer to a symptom or an antecedent. The dataset contains the following files:
- `release_evidences.json`: a JSON file describing all possible evidences considered in the dataset.
- `release_conditions.json`: a JSON file describing all pathologies considered in the dataset.
- `release_train_patients.zip`: a CSV file containing the patients of the training set.
- `release_validate_patients.zip`: a CSV file containing the patients of the validation set.
- `release_test_patients.zip`: a CSV file containing the patients of the test set.

### Evidence description
Each evidence in the `release_evidences.json` file is described using the following entries:

- `name`: name of the evidence.
  - In the English version, this is replaced with a unique, non-semantic code starting with `E`.
- `code_question`: a code allowing to identify which evidences are related. Evidences having the same `code_question` form a group of related symptoms. The value of the `code_question` refers to the evidence that need to be simulated/activated for the other members of the group to be eventually simulated.
- `question_fr`: the query, in French, associated to the evidence.
- `question_en`: the query, in English, associated to the evidence.
- `is_antecedent`: a flag indicating whether the evidence is an antecedent or a symptom.
- `data_type`: the type of the evidence. We use "B" for binary, "C" for categorical, and "M" for multi-choice.
- `default_value`: the default value of the evidence. If this value is used to characterize the evidence, then it is as if the evidence was not synthesized.
- `possible-values`: the possible values for the evidence. Only valid for categorical and multi-choice evidences.
  - In the English version, every value is replaced with a unique, non-semantic code starting with `V`.
- `value_meaning`: The meaning, in French and English, of each code that is part of the `possible-values` field. Only valid for categorical and multi-choice evidences.

### Pathology description
The file `release_conditions.json` contains information about the pathologies patients in the datasets may suffer from. Each pathology has the following attributes:
- `condition_name`: name of the pathology.
  - In the English version, the English name is used instead of the French name.
- `cond-name-fr`: name of the pathology in French.
- `cond-name-eng`: name of the pathology in English.
- `icd10-id`: ICD-10 code of the pathology.
- `severity`: the severity associated with the pathology. The lower the more severe.
- `symptoms`: data structure describing the set of symptoms characterizing the pathology. Each symptom is represented by its corresponding `name` entry in the `release_evidences.json` file.
- `antecedents`: data structure describing the set of antecedents characterizing the pathology. Each antecedent is represented by its corresponding `name` entry in the  `release_evidences.json` file.


#### Example
*English*
```json
{
    "condition_name": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "cond-name-fr": "Myasthénie grave",
    "cond-name-eng": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "icd10-id": "G70.0",
    "symptoms": {
        "E_65": {},
        "E_63": {},

        "E_90": {},
        "E_38": {},
        "E_176": {}
     },
    "antecedents": {
        "E_28": {},
        "E_204": {}
    },
    "severity": 3
}
```
*French*
```json
{
    "condition_name": "Myasthénie grave",
    "cond-name-fr": "Myasthénie grave",
    "cond-name-eng": "Myasthenia gravis",
    "icd10-id": "G70.0",
    "symptoms": {
        "dysphagie": {},
        "dysarthrie": {},

    },
    "antecedents": {
        "atcdfam_mg": {},
        "trav1": {}
    },
    "severity": 3
}
```


### Patient description
Each patient in each of the 3 sets has the following attributes:
- `AGE`: the age of the synthesized patient.
- `SEX`: the sex of the synthesized patient.
- `PATHOLOGY`: name of the ground truth pathology (cf `condition_name` property in the `release_conditions.json` file) that the synthesized patient is suffering from.
- `EVIDENCES`: list of evidences experienced by the patient. An evidence can either be binary, categorical or  multi-choice. A categorical or multi-choice evidence is represented in the format `[evidence-name]_@_[evidence-value]` where [`evidence-name`] is the name of the evidence (`name` entry in the `release_evidences.json` file) and [`evidence-value`] is a value from the `possible-values` entry. Note that for a multi-choice evidence, it is possible to have several `[evidence-name]_@_[evidence-value]` items in the evidence list, with each item being associated with a different evidence value. A binary evidence is represented as `[evidence-name]`.
- `INITIAL_EVIDENCE`: the evidence provided by the patient to kick-start an interaction with an ASD/AD system. This is useful during model evaluation for a fair comparison of ASD/AD systems as they will all begin an interaction with a given patient from the same starting point. The initial evidence is randomly selected from the evidence list mentioned above (i.e., `EVIDENCES`) and it is part of this list.
- `DIFFERENTIAL_DIAGNOSIS`: The ground truth differential diagnosis for the patient. It is represented as a list of pairs of the form `[[patho_1, proba_1], [patho_2, proba_2], ...]` where `patho_i` is the pathology name (`condition_name` entry in the `release_conditions.json` file) and `proba_i` is its related probability.
